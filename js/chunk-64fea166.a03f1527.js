Many improvement was added to this github pages that I built with VueJS. Pages, linking, data was so easy to manage with VueJS. The design was same with the previous. Black background, white text and dark blue accent. The animation of the \'clouds\' and other component is same too. Single Page Application (SPA) with VueJS is awesome!
